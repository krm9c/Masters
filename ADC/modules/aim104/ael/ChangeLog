  * Java wrapper for MULTI-IO and IN16 now produce correct values for all
    inputs.
  * AIM104-MULTI-IO drivers ADC inputs and DAC outputs are correct on
    big-endian systems and architectures with signed chars (i386).
  * libaim104-0-dev -> libaim104-dev as per recommended naming.

  * Clean up warnings in *.java by removing semi-colons from after each class
    definition.
  * Include version in source package names and installed source
    filenames.
  * Rework Makefile and ael/rules support for 2.6 and 2.4. Mostly tested with 2.6 but 2.4 appears
    to still work.
  * Update docs on compilation. Also updated kernel section to mention the
    ISA I/O offset on some non-x86 platforms.
  * Update Makefile to produce .orig.tar.bz2 on dist.
  * Dont' let modules packages depend on the linux-modules package, since
    it doesn't necessarily exist. For backwards compatability we don't
    depend on the linux-image package either.
  * Support KPKG_EXTRAV_ARG so module get installed correctly.

  * Don't build GCJ stuff by default.
  * Support building 2.6 modules with kbuild.
  * Kernel module updates:
    - work with 2.6 (module_init/module_exit and module use count stuff mostly)
    - fix some locking issues
    - remove 2.2 cruft.
    - misc cleanups
    - add note in aim104-io32.c about the outputs being incorrectly inverted.

  * Java packages are for arm and i386 only (no armbe).
  * Install J9 shared libraries in the correct location (/opt/wsdd5.0/bin).
  * Include notes in the documentation about the correct paths when
    using the Arcom Host Environment. Also mention that modern development
    kits already include the binaries.

  * ael/control, ael/rules, ael/j9-*.files: Build j9-aim104-* packages.
  * include/linux/arcom/aim104.h: Fix definition of ioctl values. (They
    should have the same value though.)
  * Makefile, java/Makefile, java/com/arcom/aim104/Makefile: Install Java
    library.
  * java/com/arcom/aim104/Makefile: Change libaim104_java.so version/soname.
